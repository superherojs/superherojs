Contributing to Superhero.js
===

We at Superhero.js love Open Source and really appreciate pull requests with
great content. For this to go as smoothly as possible and to create a good
forum to discuss content and different resources, we need some guidelines.

## Superhero.js Vision

Superhero.js isn't a collection of the latest framework tutorial, but focuses
on lasting knowledge for platform and craftsmanship. Resources should preferably
be generic rather than specific tools, libraries and framework. Instead of
learning abstractions like frameworks, Superhero.js favor understanding these
abstractions through a fundemental knowledge of platform and language.

## Contributing Guidelines

* Each Pull Request should only contain one addition, change or delete.
* There shouldn't be any duplicate issues. Make sure to see already closed issues.
* Pull Requests with additions should describe why the resource is awesome and
  why it would be a great addition to the site. Please share with us what
  you learned from it and what others can learn.
* We will strive to keep the quality of our resources up, and with that we try
  to not have many overlapping resources. Maybe another resource is better than
  what we all ready have?
* Be amazing and help us create a great set of resources to help others getting
  into Javascript.


## Some Topics We're Interested In

We are always interested in getting pull requests with new resources, and maybe
replace some of our existing links, but there are a few gaps in our collection
that we are especially interested in covering. Some of these topics include:

* JavaScript architecture. How to build and structure large-scale JavaScript apps
* Virtual DOM and component based architecture
* Building JavaScript apps and asset management. We don't want resources that
  focus on Grunt, Gulp or Makefiles, but focus on those things that matter
  whatever tool you choose.

Remember, if you are unsure if you got a good resource or you just want to discuss
some existing resources we are more than willing to participate in a discussion.
Just open an Issue! You can also send a mail at
